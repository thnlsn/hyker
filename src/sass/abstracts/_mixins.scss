// Mixins are reusable pieces of code that can be included in other css
@mixin clearfix {
  // & will translate to whatever css selector we are within when we call the mixin then it will add ::after to that
  &::after {
    // Set content property otherwise pseudo elements will not appear on the page, it is empty because we dont actually want to see it
    content: '';
    // display: table is simply the standard for a clearfix hack
    display: table;
    // We float both to make this mixin more reuseable, so it will clear float right AND left, so it will be useful for both scenarios
    clear: both;
  }
}

@mixin text-gradient($direction, $colorOne, $colorTwo) {
