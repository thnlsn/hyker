  // This is being set for the purpose of easy rem calculations (font, images, styles etc.) throughout the application
  // Browser default size is 16px, but we want to set it to a percentage in case people with bad eyes have a different default
  // The percentage is 62.5% because it equates to 10px (which will make rem calculations easy) assuming the 16px default
