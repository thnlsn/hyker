<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is Hyker, an imaginary app that aims to streamline the hiking process for both veterans and newcomers alike. Options include all difficulties, such as the inclusion of hotels for a more casual trip, or as bare bones bringing your own tents, if you so please. Book a trip for your family, friends, or make some new friends by joining in with some other hikers!

## Background

This project was built alongside an Advanced CSS & Sass course on uDemy by Jonas Schtedmann. The project included no JavaScript, however, I built it using React & Javascript functionality to add more to the page that would have been impossible limited only to CSS & Sass. As for the CSS/Sass, I made concentrated effort to employ advanced philosophies and strategies. For example, responsive images to serve only images that are appropriate for the device as improve to performace. Graceful degradation via the @supports at-rule (feature queries) to provide alternate styles for devices that may not support modern css properties.
