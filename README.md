<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is Hyker, an imaginary app that aims to streamline the hiking process for both veterans and newcomers alike. Options include all difficulties, such as the inclusion of hotels for a more casual trip, or as bare bones bringing your own tents, if you so please. Book a trip for your family, friends, or make some new friends by joining in with some other hikers!

### Built With

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
-   [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)
